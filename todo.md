# To Do

* Is it useful to have `D4xdata.standardize()` return the `lmfit` object?
* How to deal with `D4xdata.standardize()` having different effects depending on `method`?
* Add changelog.md
* Turn `D4xdata.R17_VPDB` (and perhaps also `D4xdata.R18_VPDB`) into a property, so that there is no risk of redefining `D4xdata.R17_VSMOW` without updating `D4xdata.R17_VPDB`; In this case, the setter methods for `D4xdata.R17_VPDB` and `D4xdata.R18_VPDB` should raise an exception.
* improve `test_virtual_data()` to populate with non-default parameters
